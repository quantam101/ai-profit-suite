codex/implement-alerts-for-underperforming-products
# AI Profit Suite

This repository contains simple utilities to help convert low-performing products into revenue.

## Detecting Low Performers

Use `detect_and_alert.py` to scan a CSV of product performance and trigger discounts.

```
python detect_and_alert.py products.csv discounts.csv
```

The script checks each product's `units_sold` against the `LOW_PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD` environment variable (default `10`). Products below this threshold are marked for a flash sale using `DISCOUNT_PERCENT` (default `20`).

If [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) is installed and credentials are provided via environment variables, the script sends an SMS summary. It also outputs a CSV (`discounts.csv`) that can be imported into Glide to create flash sale alerts.

### Required Environment Variables for SMS

- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER`
- `TO_NUMBER` (recipient)

### Example Product Data

See `products.csv` for a sample dataset.

codex/generate-daily-earnings-summary-report
# AI Profit Suite

    "facebook": 80
  },
  "actions_taken": [
    "Updated product page",
    "Launched ad campaign"
  ]
}
```

The message is formatted and sent to the configured phone number.

#### Usage

   ```bash
   pip install twilio
   ```
2. Set Twilio credentials and phone numbers as environment variables:
   - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
   - `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER`
   - `TWILIO_TO_NUMBER`

# AI Profit Suite

This project demonstrates how to gather trending product information from
supported platforms using official APIs. It also shows how to combine these
results to highlight the top items to promote.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)
- API credentials for any services you want to query (e.g. Amazon PA API,
  Etsy API). TikTok's trending data is not fetched because a public API is not
  available.

## Usage

1. Set the environment variables for the services you wish to enable:

   ```bash
   export ETSY_API_KEY=your_etsy_key
   export AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY=your_amazon_key
   export AMAZON_SECRET_KEY=your_amazon_secret
   export AMAZON_ASSOC_TAG=your_amazon_associate_tag
   ```

   TikTok trending retrieval is not implemented; consult TikTok's terms of
   service for approved methods.

2. Run the suite:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The script will attempt to fetch trending items and print up to five products to
consider promoting.

```bash
python3 main.py
```

codex/fetch-all-branches-and-checkout-main
You will be prompted to rate each learning strategy from 1 (least helpful) to 5 (most helpful). Enter `0` if the prompt was not helpful and should be discarded. After rating, the updated prompt list is saved to `prompts.json` and displayed in ranked order.

## Customizing
Edit prompts.json to add your own learning strategies.
