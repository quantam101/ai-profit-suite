This repository provides utilities for managing shared resources.

## Uploading Resources

Use `python main.py upload <path-or-url>` to add a guide, file, or link to the
`shared_resources` directory. The command will copy local files or create a
`.url` file containing the link.

Example:

```bash
python main.py upload https://example.com/guide
```
